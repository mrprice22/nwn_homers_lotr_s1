// q_rid_inc.nss — The Riddle Game shared helpers (roadmap: riddle-game)
//
// T1 weekly dialogue minigame, journal tag "riddle_game". A whispering
// wretch (q_rid_wretch — strongly implied to be, but never named, Gollum)
// squats in Bree Cave and plays the old game: seven riddles, answered by
// dialogue choice. Five or more right of seven wins a prize from its hoard;
// fewer wins nothing but taunting. One attempt per calendar week
// (quest_cd_inc QCD_IsDoneThisWeek — resets at the start of the ISO week,
// UTC, matching the "weekly" intent; win or lose, the week is stamped).
//
// The wretch is script-spawned at waypoint AP_riddlegame_1 (Bree Cave) by
// q_rid_spawn, fired from the area's OnEnter wrapper q_rid_enter. It no-ops
// gracefully until the admin places the waypoint, and never double-spawns.
// The placed CR-1029 Gollum boss (gollum.utc, Roll of the Fallen) is a
// completely separate blueprint and is untouched.
//
// Weekly riddle set: the bank holds QRID_COUNT riddles; each ISO week a
// deterministic seed (strftime('%Y%W') as an integer, so the whole server
// shares one weekly set) picks QRID_ASKED distinct riddles via a
// stride-through-the-bank walk (offset + k*step mod 16, step odd so it is
// coprime with 16), and rotates the displayed answer order per riddle so
// the correct letter moves around. A mid-game relog just clears the session
// locals — the game restarts from riddle one (same weekly set); the weekly
// stamp is only written when the seventh answer lands.
//
// Session state (locals on the PC, cleared/reset by q_rid_begin):
//   Q_RID_ACTIVE  1 while a game is running
//   Q_RID_SEED    the week seed captured at game start
//   Q_RID_IDX     riddles answered so far (0..7)
//   Q_RID_SCORE   correct answers so far
//   Q_RID_SLOT    which displayed option (1..4) is correct for the shown riddle
//   Q_RID_LAST    1 if the most recent answer was correct
//   Q_RID_RESULT  set at game end: 1 = won, 2 = lost
//
// Custom tokens (registered per-display by the StartingConditionals):
