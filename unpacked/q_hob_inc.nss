// q_hob_inc.nss — "Concerning Hobbits" Shire-genealogy quiz (roadmap: concerning-hobbits)
//
// T1 (L5) daily dialogue minigame, journal tag "concern_hob". Odo Proudfoot
// (q_hob_odo), a Hobbiton genealogist, is forever settling a dispute at the
// Ivy Bush over who is cousin to whom. He puts five questions of Shire
// lineage to the PC; answer four of five rightly to win gold, XP and a
// keepsake from the family stores. One attempt per calendar day (UTC), win
// or lose (quest_cd_inc QCD_IsDoneToday / QCD_Stamp).
//
// "The correct answer rotates by season." The bank holds QHOB_COUNT
// questions; a per-season seed (derived from the in-game calendar,
// GetCalendarYear()*4 + season) deterministically picks QHOB_ASKED distinct
// questions (stride offset + k*step mod 16, step odd so coprime with 16) and
// rotates the displayed answer order per question so the correct letter moves
// with the season. Everything is a pure function of (season seed, question
// index), so re-showing a question is idempotent and the whole server shares
// one seasonal dispute.
//
// Odo is script-spawned at waypoint AP_concerninghobbits_1 (Hobbiton) by
// q_hob_spawn, fired from the area OnEnter wrapper q_hob_enter. It no-ops
// gracefully until the admin places the waypoint (see the roadmap item manual_steps)
// and never double-spawns.
//
// Session state (locals on the PC, reset by q_hob_begin):
//   Q_HOB_ACTIVE  1 while a game is running
//   Q_HOB_SEED    the season seed captured at game start
//   Q_HOB_IDX     questions answered so far (0..5)
//   Q_HOB_SCORE   correct answers so far
//   Q_HOB_SLOT    which displayed option (1..4) is correct for the shown q.
//   Q_HOB_LAST    1 if the most recent answer was correct
//   Q_HOB_RESULT  set at game end: 1 = won, 2 = lost
//
// Custom tokens (registered per-display by the StartingConditionals):
