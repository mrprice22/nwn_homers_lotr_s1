// The Riddle Game (roadmap: riddle-game)
// (Re)spawn helper for the whispering wretch in Bree Cave. Fired from the
// area's OnEnter wrapper (q_rid_enter), so the wretch is always waiting by
// the time a player crosses the cave. No-ops gracefully until the admin
// places waypoint AP_riddlegame_1 in breecave (see the roadmap item manual_steps)
// and never double-spawns. The placed Gollum boss is a separate blueprint.
