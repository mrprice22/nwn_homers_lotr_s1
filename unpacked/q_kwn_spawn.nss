// q_kwn_spawn — (re)spawn helper for the banner-stone on the Pelennor
// Fields (roadmap: knight-westernesse-quest). Fired from the field's
// OnEnter wrapper (q_kwn_ent1) and re-checked when the quest is accepted
// and when the standard is released. No-ops gracefully until the admin
// places waypoint AP_knightwest_1 (see the roadmap item manual_steps) and
// never double-spawns.
