// q_bkg_altar -- the Blackguards' fall-rite (roadmap: blackguard-quest).
// OnUsed of the torture-rack in the Keep of Barad-Dur
// (baraddurkeep.git.json, existing placed instance 94 of plc_torture1
// reused -- retagged BkgFallAltar, made usable; it was Static with no
// scripts, so there is nothing to chain, and no code referenced the old
// tag "Torture Equipment"). Runs the Black Oath for a PC on the rite:
//
//   * The oath's condition: come to the rack bleeding (QBKG_ComesBleeding
//     -- GetCurrentHitPoints < GetMaxHitPoints, "blood freely given").
//     Come whole and the rite fails with a flavor message; nothing
//     granted, nothing shifted. Retry allowed -- take a wound and swear
//     again. Deterministic: the wound is the test, no dice.
//   * Bleeding at stage 1: THIS is the fall. The rite drives the PC's
//     alignment hard toward evil ONCE (AdjustAlignment, ALIGNMENT_EVIL,
//     bAllPartyMembers = FALSE so only the swearer falls), brands the
//     black iron token into the hand, and moves stage 1 -> 2 + journal 2.
//   * At stage 2 with the brand lost, re-gives the brand but does NOT
//     shift again (the fall already happened; never duplicates -- the item
//     is plot + cursed and only the finish consumes it).
//
// Does nothing for PCs not on the rite -- to everyone else it is just the
// Dark Tower's cold iron.
#include "q_bkg_inc"
// The fall also commits the character to the Evil (Sauron) faction and locks
// them out of the Good light-shaft (Faction_SetOath), mirroring the Paladin oath.
