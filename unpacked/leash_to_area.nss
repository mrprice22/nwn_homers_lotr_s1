// boss) out of its home area and across the module to fight other bosses. This
// fires whenever any object enters the area (no heartbeat needed). If the
// entering creature is in an area other than the one it spawned in, it is sent
// straight back to its spawn point.

// LocalLocation, recorded by leash_init (at module load) or by the creature's
// own OnSpawn (nw_c2_default9 / x2_def_spawn).
//
// To exempt a creature that is MEANT to travel between areas (escorts, ambient
// wanderers, scripted plot movers), set local int "NO_LEASH" = 1 on its
// blueprint or instance.
