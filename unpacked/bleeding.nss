// --- LOTR petrification timeout (roadmap petrification-timeout-2) ---
// The original fix (commit 46aa7efaa1e) edited DoPetrification() in the module's
// x0_i0_spells.nss include, but in-game petrification comes from base-game
// precompiled gaze/flesh-to-stone scripts that inline the STOCK DoPetrification,
// so that edit never ran and PCs stayed petrified indefinitely. This central,
// source-independent watcher runs off the module heartbeat instead: it works no
// matter what applied the petrify. After PETRIFY_TIMEOUT seconds the PC is killed
// via EffectDeath (routing through ondeath020 -> death/respawn GUI), with
// escalating warnings both in chat and as floating text every PETRIFY_WARN_BUCKET
// seconds. The heartbeat fires every HB_INTERVAL seconds (standard module HB).
