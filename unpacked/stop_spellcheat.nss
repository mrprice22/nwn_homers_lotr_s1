//Drop by my PW Blackstone_Keep(CEP) located under Roleplay and say hello.

//I had to change the way I was doing this because +scarface+ told of a another exploit that the pervious version didn't stop.
//Thank you +scarface+ for your help in testing.
//This script will stop the counterspell infinite spell exploit without affecting counterspell's normal operation


//Put this code in your OnModuleLoad Event script

//SetModuleSwitch(MODULE_VAR_OVERRIDE_SPELLSCRIPT,TRUE);
//SetModuleOverrideSpellscript("stop_spellcheat");


//Save this in a script named stop_spellcheat

#include "fat_inc"

        I recommend not removing this.
        There is still a possibility a really coordinated player could get a feel for the timing and still be able to exploit.
        This will help ensure that doesn't happen.
