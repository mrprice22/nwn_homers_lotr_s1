"""The identity bridge — three ID spaces, one player roster.

The season's data does not agree with itself about what a "player" is:

1. **CD key** (``QR69DAFR``) — the vault directory name, and the key in
   ``bestiarydb.kills``, ``meritdb``, ``admindb.houses``, ``fam_*_<CDKEY>`` bank
   entries and ``activity-sessions.json``. This is the real account identity, and
   the one everything is normalised onto.
2. **playerid string** — how the NWNX ``db`` key/value tables (``bankdb``,
   ``meaningwave``) key their rows: ``GetPCPlayerName() + GetName()``, *truncated*
   by the engine (observed max 29 chars), e.g. ``-Methonash-Methonash, -Unho``.
   There is no separator, so it can only be resolved by reconstructing the
   candidate from a known account + character pair and matching by prefix.
3. **roadmap.yaml ``player:``** — a hand-typed display string
   (``Piskan (Alek Cain)``). Resolved through the alias table in ``categories.py``,
   never guessed.

Nothing here silently drops a row it cannot place: unmatched playerids are
collected and reported, because a missing bridge shows up as a player mysteriously
having no banked gold rather than as an error.
