"""Local web GUI for editing the `ideas` backlog in roadmap.yaml.

roadmap.yaml is the source of truth for the public dev roadmap AND the merit-
tracking backlog (shipped player ideas credit a submitter with Merit). It is
edited constantly and typo-prone in the places that matter most: player names,
group ids, statuses, and dupe_of references. This tool serves a small browser
form whose pickers are sourced from the file's own existing values, so those
fields can't drift on a typo. It validates with gen-roadmap.py's own validate()
before writing, and only rewrites the `ideas:` block (the last top-level key),
preserving the header comments and the meta/groups/redemption/housing blocks
verbatim. Per-item leading comment blocks (the section headers) travel with
their item by id.

Usage:
    python3 bin/roadmap-editor.py            # serve + open a browser
    python3 bin/roadmap-editor.py --serve    # serve only (used by the systemd unit)
    python3 bin/roadmap-editor.py --port N   # bind a different port (default 8765)
