"""Rebrand every season-scoped reference in this repo from the season block.

One idempotent pass. `server.env`'s SEASON_* block is the single source of
truth; this script derives and writes everything downstream of it — the module
description's connect string and wiki link, the guide/merit NPC wiki links, the
login floaty text, the Recent Updates board's roadmap link, the Cloudflare
worker name and
redirect target, the roadmap editor's links, and (from season 2 on) the module
and server names in nasher.cfg and server.env.

ROLES. `SEASON_ROLE` is one of `live | test | dev | archive`:

    live     this season is production, reachable at the apex. Its own
             season<N>. subdomain 301s to the apex (src/index.js).
    test     an early-access realm on the alternate port, at season<N>.
    dev      the PERMANENT test realm — never a season, never production.
             All of its names are number-independent (homers_lotr_test.mod,
             "Homer's LOTR TEST", dev.homerslotr.com), because SEASON_NUM here
             tracks whichever season it currently feeds and bumping it must
             not rename the module.
    archive  a retired season, frozen at its own season<N>. subdomain.

NAMING is uniform across every realm, with no exemptions:

    seasons (live/test/archive)   homers_lotr_s<N>.mod   "Homer's LOTR Season <N>"
    the dev realm                 homers_lotr_test.mod   "Homer's LOTR TEST"

NWN_MODULE must equal the installed .mod filename minus the extension, or
nwserver exits at boot with module-not-found; this script writes them as a pair.

Only ONE repo may hold each of `live` and `dev`. Development happens in the
dev repo and reaches production through bin/season-promote.sh, which re-runs
this script in the target so the promoted tree is rebranded for wherever it
landed. That is why every rule here is shape-matched: promotion copies a tree
branded for one environment into another, and this pass has to correct it in
full, from whatever it previously said.

Behaviour that differs between dev and production (cheat gear, dev NPCs, the
early-access wipe notice) is NOT here — see bin/season-profile.py. This script
owns strings and URLs; that one owns flags.

Usage:
    python3 bin/season-brand.py              # dry run — show what would change
    python3 bin/season-brand.py --apply      # write
    python3 bin/season-brand.py --check      # exit 1 if anything is out of date
    python3 bin/season-brand.py --diff       # dry run with full unified diffs

`--check` is what tests/check_season_brand.py runs as a build gate, so a repo
whose tree has drifted from its season block cannot be packed.

IDEMPOTENCE is the contract: a second `--apply` must produce no diff. Every rule
therefore matches the *shape* of the target (any host in the homerslotr.com
family, any name in the "name" field) rather than a specific old value, so
re-running re-matches the value it just wrote and does nothing.

The "family" is the apex and `season<N>.` ONLY — see WIKI_HOST_RE. Any other
subdomain of homerslotr.com is an ARCHIVE WIKI for one of the forked modules
(`lotr.homerslotr.com` = the 2008 original, `2009.homerslotr.com` = Homer's LOTR
Edit). Those are separate, read-only modules, not seasons of this one: they are
never rebuilt, never rebranded, and must survive every cutover untouched. Do not
"fix" a rule so that it reaches them.

NEVER substitute a bare port number. `5121` occurs as a float fraction in at
least seven .git.json files ("value": 54.5121, -22.5121, …) and as a
SetListenPattern match-ID in unpacked/roulette_os.nss. A global port
substitution silently moves placeables and breaks a conversation. The port is
touched only inside the module description's "Connect:" line.

Adding a new branded string? Add a rule here, then re-run the completeness grep
from season-cutover-prereqs.md item 8. unpacked/module.jrl.json currently needs
no rule — its only link is Discord and its wiki references are host-free
breadcrumbs ("wiki: Manual > Customizations") — but it is the likeliest place
for a new bare URL to appear, so re-check it each cutover.

    `index.html` at the repo root is the hand-maintained source this script
    owns. `docs/index.html` is GENERATED from it by the wiki build, which
    injects the header/footer around it - so rebranding updates the source and
    leaves the published page untouched until someone runs a full wiki refresh.

    Nothing else notices that gap, and it is publicly visible the whole time.
    It bit the season 1 -> 2 cutover: the dev realm was rebranded onto port
    5123, but dev.homerslotr.com kept telling visitors to connect on 5122 -
    production's port - because docs/ still held the early-access build.

    Deliberately an ADVISORY, not a build gate. docs/ legitimately lags between
    a rebrand and the next scheduled wiki publish, and failing `--check` here
    would block a module repack over a stale wiki, which is the wrong coupling.
    It is printed loudly right after the rebrand instead, which is the moment
    the operator can act on it.
